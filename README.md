# Queensland Adventures Website

## Description:

This project is an interactive website designed to promote tourism in Queensland, Australia, being created as part of Assignment 1 for course 2701ICT Intelligent Media Systems. It displays photos and information from famous Queensland tourism destinations, such as the Brisbane, Whitsunday Islands, and Gold Coast, utilizing APIs from multiple sources.

## Development Process:

• Conducted research on popular Queensland tourism destinations and their photo resources on Flickr, the primary API used for fetching photos.

• Implemented the website by breaking down the project into smaller tasks, focusing on features like destination lists, selected destination data, recent view, and navigation.

• Ensured both functionality and visual aspects were developed in sync by adjusting feature designs during implementation.

• Conducted regular testing to identify and resolve bugs or issues, especially related to data fetching from APIs.

• Designed the website layout to be responsive with three breakpoints, adjusting CSS code with media queries for screens below 768px width.


## Open-ended Features:

• Photo Quality: Focused on fetching and displaying high-quality photos by filtering them based on geolocation and relevance sorting.

• Different Navigation: Implemented three different navigation styles and locations to enhance website responsiveness.

• Weather API: Integrated real-time weather data fetching from APIs to display current weather conditions at each destination, including temperature, condition, wind speed, rain probability, and UV index.


## Future Improvements:

• Plan element sizes and widths beforehand to enhance visual consistency.

• Enhance user experience with additional interactive features.

• Optimize performance for faster loading times.
